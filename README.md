It was a birthday of one of my friend and I wanted to wish him in a special way. So I put together this animated web page real quick to say Happy Birthday.

Feel free to use it to wish your friend if you want.
You can get it running in a few easy steps:

* Fork the repository
* Open `customize.json` and replace name/wish-message/image with your own
* Turn on GitHub pages for the repository (Settings > GitHub Pages)
* Send the URL that you get at the above step to your friend

Edit the JSON file for easy and quick customizability. But in that case, leave the JSON fields empty since it overwrites the HTML.

Stay happy and keep the people you care about happy. :)
